## Inital Experiments with Polymer ##

Experiment 1: Get MathJax rendering to work.   

- MathJax rendering seems to have a problem with the template tag.  Trying a similar experiment with AngularDart to see if I can get any further.
- Observation: Both polymer and angular seem to exhibit an odd UX behavior when moving the cursor back to correct a bound input.  After each keystroke, the cursor jumps to the end of the already entered text regardless of whether the user is finished correcting the earlier text, which is extremely undesirable.
